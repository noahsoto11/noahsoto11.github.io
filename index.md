### CPSC 120

# Lab 5 
    Lab 5, part 3 was one of the first labs I actually liked because it helped me to learn about the operations of the game Blackjack which I am fond of, and how to recreate it with code. 

# Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 2 is focused on words from a file, with these words the program can be able to determine the pressence of certain words along with words that are misspelled. This helped me in sorting through information from files. 

# Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 1 was a hard but interesting lab, which involved the population density of all 50 states along with learning how to filter through the information of the files to print out specifics to these states.
